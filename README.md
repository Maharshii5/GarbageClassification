# GarbageClassification
Week 1: Foundation and Initial Data Work
In the first week, I focused on setting up the groundwork and getting my hands on some data.

Changes/Activities I Made:
Project Initialization: I set up my development environment (e.g., installed Python, relevant libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn), created my project folders, and established version control (like Git).
Initial Data Collection & Exploration: A significant change I made was the acquisition of my initial dataset. This involved:
Downloading pre-existing image datasets of different waste types (plastic, paper, organic, metal, glass, etc.).
Beginning the process of collecting my own images because I decided to build a custom dataset.
Performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the number of classes, image dimensions, and data distribution.
Defining Scope & Goals: I refined my project's scope, identifying the specific types of garbage I aimed to classify and the success metrics.
Research & Literature Review: I spent time researching existing garbage classification models, common deep learning architectures (like CNNs), and best practices, which led to decisions about potential model approaches.
Week 2: Data Preprocessing & Model Prototyping
The second week moved into preparing the data for a model and even training a very basic prototype.

Changes/Activities I Made:
Data Preprocessing Pipeline: A major change here was the implementation of my data preprocessing steps. This included:
Image resizing and normalization to a consistent format.
Data splitting (training, validation, and test sets).
Initial data augmentation techniques (e.g., simple rotations, flips) to increase my dataset size and diversity.
Model Architecture Selection/Initial Implementation: I made decisions about, and started implementing, my initial model architecture. This involved:
Choosing a pre-trained model for transfer learning (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet) and adapting its final layers.
Building a simple custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch as a baseline.
First Training Run (Prototype): A key change was running my very first training iterations on a small subset of data or with a simple model. This is where I saw if my data pipeline worked and if the model showed any signs of learning, even if accuracy was low.
Evaluation Metrics Setup: I set up the code to track initial performance metrics like accuracy or loss during training.
In essence, the first week was about gathering resources and laying the foundation, while the second week was about cleaning up those resources (data) and starting to build a rough version of my core solution (the model).
1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system for classifying various types of garbage (e.g., plastic, paper, organic, metal, glass, cardboard). By leveraging deep learning techniques, the goal is to automate a crucial step in waste management, ultimately contributing to more efficient recycling and a cleaner environment. This is currently a prototype focusing on the core classification challenge.

2. Project Status: Week 2 Progress Summary
As of Week 2, the foundational elements for this project are in place, and an initial model prototype has been developed and tested.

Key Achievements in Week 1:
Project Setup: I initialized the project repository, set up the development environment with essential libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib, and integrated Git for version control.
Initial Data Acquisition: I successfully acquired an initial dataset of garbage images. This dataset was sourced from [mention specific source, e.g., Kaggle's "Garbage Classification" dataset, a custom collection I started, etc.].
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed an initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure, including the distribution of classes and typical image characteristics (e.g., dimensions, color channels).
Research & Architecture Selection: I conducted research into existing garbage classification methods and various deep learning architectures. Based on this, I decided on a preliminary approach for the model architecture, focusing on [mention your chosen approach, e.g., utilizing transfer learning with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like MobileNetV2, or building a custom CNN from scratch].
Key Achievements in Week 2:
Data Preprocessing Pipeline: I implemented a robust data preprocessing pipeline. This included:
Image resizing to a uniform dimension (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
Image normalization to scale pixel values appropriately for model input.
Dataset splitting into training, validation, and test sets (typically 80/10/10%).
Applying basic data augmentation techniques such as [mention techniques like random rotations, horizontal flips, zooming] to increase dataset diversity and prevent overfitting.
Model Prototyping: I built and configured the initial deep learning model based on [mention chosen model, e.g., fine-tuned MobileNetV2, a simple custom CNN with X convolutional layers].
First Training Run: I successfully executed the very first training run of the model. This confirmed the functionality of both the data pipeline and the model's ability to learn from the data, even if the initial accuracy was low.
Evaluation Metrics Setup: I configured the necessary metrics, such as accuracy and loss, to monitor the model's performance during training.
3. Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python [mention version, e.g., 3.8 or higher]
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone [Your Repository URL]
cd [Your Project Folder Name]
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
3. **Install dependencies:**bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Note: You'll need to create a requirements.txt file based on the libraries you used. You can generate one using pip freeze > requirements.txt from within your activated virtual environment.)

4. Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [Name of Dataset, e.g., "The TrashNet Dataset", "My Custom Garbage Image Collection"]. It currently contains [Approximate Number] images categorized into [Number] distinct classes: [List Classes, e.g., "Plastic", "Paper", "Organic", "Metal", "Glass", "Cardboard"].

The dataset is expected to be organized within the [specify path, e.g., 'data/'] directory, with subfolders for each class (e.g., data/train/plastic/, data/validation/paper/).

5. Usage
While the project is still in its early stages, you can typically [describe what one can do, e.g., "run the training script", "perform basic inference"].

To [e.g., train the model]:

Bash

python train.py
(Note: You will develop train.py and other scripts as the project progresses. For now, this is a placeholder.)
